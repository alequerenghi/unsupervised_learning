    "## Notes\n",
    "k-means can be quite slow if not programmed correctly. Of course, the goal of the exercise is not to produce the most efficient code (ie. itâ€™s ok if it is a little slow) but for you to understand the mechanisms of the algorithms. In practical application, you would likely use Cython as programming tool other than Python directly (or use already-made implementations).  \n",

    "- use numpy\n",
    "- try to use vectorization when possible instead of for loops, as it increases the efficiency of the code"
